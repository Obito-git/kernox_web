### Code todo:

- review what deps I can move to dev deps, as I understand something like pagefind is used only during the build. And when it is not used in runtime, npm anyway includes it to the bundle.
- review robots.txt
- add filters to leetcode problems search and search only in leetcode problems, not on every page
- refactor leetcode page, when too much problems will be there
