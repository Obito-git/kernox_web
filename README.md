### Code todo:

- add more problems with different difficulty to insure the sort by difficulty works fine
- there are still wrong names like post for problems etc from copy-paste. Review all variables names
- review robots.txt
- replace hardcoded collection names in components to enum
- delete other domains on prod?
- check all files on git are needed
- add filters to leetcode problems search and search only in leetcode problems, not on every page
- refactor leetcode page, when too much problems will be solved
- review animate class usage, probably I can delete it in a lot of places, because it is inherited from parent element
