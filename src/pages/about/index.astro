            The primary goal of this micro-blog is to share my ambitious hobby:
            writing an operating system from scratch in Rust🦀 and assembly. In
            the future, I might also dive into writing a compiler or even
            creating a programming language from scratch. I already have several
            project ideas, but as every developer knows, it's easy to lose
            motivation. This simple website is meant to be a source of
            inspiration for myself, even if I end up being the only one reading
            it.

            At 42, we began learning computer science with C, mostly without the
            standard library, or with a restricted set of allowed functions. The
            first school project was called <span class="highlight">libft</span
            >, where I had to rewrite around 50 standard library functions like <span
              class="highlight">strlen</span
            >, <span class="highlight">strcpy</span>, <span class="highlight"
              >strcmp</span
            >, and others. One of the early projects was also implementing <span
              class="highlight">printf</span
            >. For me, the philosophy is simple: if you want to use something,
            you should understand how it works internally. Projects like a
            <span class="highlight">mini-shell</span> or <span class="highlight"
              >malloc</span
            > helped develop in me a habit of almost always wanting to look under
            the hood to understand how things work exactly.

            I didn’t enjoy C++, and working with C often became boring for me.
            To finish school and complete internships, I shifted to the world of
            web development, especially back-end programming. I picked up basic
            front-end skills but focused more on back-end development in Java to
            start earning some money.

            After completing my internships, I began working as a software
            developer at

            , primarily using Java and the Spring framework. My main responsibilities
            include refactoring legacy code, developing services to ensure consistency
            and scalability, and creating shared mechanisms between microservices.

            During my work, I discovered Rust🦀 and learned some basic assembly.
            I fell in love with Rust🦀, not just because it isn’t another
            C-style language, but because it is multiparadigm and, in my
            opinion, incorporates some of the best ideas from the programming
            world. Alongside the Cargo package manager—which is completely
            missing in C and C++—Rust🦀 has become my favorite language. I’d
            like to try Zig one day, but that’s not on the horizon just yet.

            I hope🤞 to make this blog as detailed as possible, covering almost
            all the theory and every line of code with clear explanations.
