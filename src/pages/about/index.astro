                        The primary goal of this micro-blog is to share my ambitious hobby:
                        writing an operating system from scratch in Rustü¶Ä and assembly. In the future,
                        I might also dive into writing a compiler, re-implementing some interesting data structures
                        and iterators, or even creating a programming language from scratch. I have several
                        project ideas, but as every developer knows, it's easy to lose
                        motivation. This simple website is meant to be a source of
                        inspiration for myself, even if I end up being the only one reading
                        it.

                        , we began learning computer science with C, mostly without the
                        standard library, or with a restricted set of allowed functions. The
                        first school project was called <span class="highlight">libft</span
                    >, where I had to rewrite around 50 standard library functions like <span
                            class="highlight">strlen</span
                    >, <span class="highlight">strcpy</span>, <span class="highlight"
                    >strcmp</span
                    >, and others. One of the early projects was also implementing <span
                            class="highlight">printf</span
                    >. For me, the philosophy is simple: if you want to use something,
                        you should understand how it works internally. Projects like a
                        <span class="highlight">mini-shell</span> or <span class="highlight"
                    >malloc</span
                    > helped develop in me a habit of almost always wanting to look under
                        the hood to understand how things work exactly.

                        I didn‚Äôt enjoy C++, and working with C often became boring for me.
                        To finish school and complete internships, I shifted to the world of
                        web development, especially back-end programming. I picked up basic
                        front-end skills but focused more on back-end development in Java to
                        start earning some money.

                        During my work, I discovered Rustü¶Ä and learned some basic assembly.
                        I fell in love with Rustü¶Ä, not just because it isn‚Äôt another
                        C-style language, but because it is multiparadigm and, in my
                        opinion, incorporates some of the best ideas from the programming
                        world. Alongside the Cargo package manager‚Äîwhich is completely
                        missing in C and C++‚ÄîRustü¶Ä has become my favorite language. I‚Äôd
                        like to try Zig one day, but that‚Äôs not on the horizon just yet.
