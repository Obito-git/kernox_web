                        This series is intended to focus on building a Rust kernel from scratch for 32-bit systems in its early stages.
                        64-bit support will come later, probably along with implementations for ARM or RISC-V.

                        However, I don't have enough time right now to make it as polished as I envision it.
                        I will mainly publish my LeetCode solutions here until my summer vacation in 2025.
                    </p>
                    <p class="animate">
                        I plan to keep some kernel pages as a reminder to work on it every time I visit this site. Have fun!
