                        This series is intended to focus on building a Rust
                        kernel from scratch for 32-bit systems in its early
                        stages. 64-bit support will come later, probably along
                        with implementations for ARM or RISC-V.

                        However, I don't have enough time right now to make it
                        as polished as I envision it. I will mainly publish my
                        LeetCode solutions here until my summer vacation in
                        2025.

                        I plan to keep some kernel pages as a reminder to work
                        on it every time I visit this site. Have fun!
